I'm trying to reimplement "[Jurnal Cogito](https://lsfcogito.org)", specifically the later design, by recreating it in LaTeX environment, since back then I thought these would be easier if using ML approach to lay the texts.

Notable changes from the original are as follow:
- Changing the fonts from Goudy Old Style to TG Pagella to ensure proper support of math character. It also has wider Unicode support.
